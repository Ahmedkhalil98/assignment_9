        "The city's origin dates back to the Stone Age, and it became part of the Assyrian Empire, then the Babylonian Empire before it fell into the hands of Achaemenid Empire after the Fall of Babylon, and subsequently fell into the hands of Alexander the Great and the Romans. It became an important center of Syriac Christianity where it was known as \"ܒܝܬ ܢܘܗܕܪܐ\" Beth Nohdry, before fading out after the conquests of Mesopotamia by Tamerlane. According to Evliya Çelebi, the city was initially called Dohuk-e Dasinya, named after the militant Dasini tribe who were believers of Yazidism. The Yazidi population is still relatively significant[vague], but has decreased due to persecution. This made it possible for Muslims, Christians and Jews to settle in the town."
